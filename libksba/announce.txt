Hello!

We are pleased to announce version 1.0.4 of Libksba.

Libksba is an X.509 and CMS (PKCS#7) library.  It is for example
required to build the S/MIME part of GnuPG-2 (gpgsm).  The only build
requirement for Libksba itself is the libgpg-error package.  There are
no other dependencies; actual cryptographic operations need to be done
by the user.  Libksba is distributed under the GPLv3+.  There are no
user tools accompanying this software, thus it is mostly relevant to
developers.

This is a maintenance release.

You may download the library and its OpenPGP signature from:

  ftp://ftp.gnupg.org/gcrypt/libksba/libksba-1.0.4.tar.bz2 (553k)
  ftp://ftp.gnupg.org/gcrypt/libksba/libksba-1.0.4.tar.bz2.sig

As an alternative you may use a patch file to upgrade the previous
version of the library:

  ftp://ftp.gnupg.org/gcrypt/libksba/libksba-1.0.3-1.0.4.diff.bz2 (144k)

(the reason for the large patch file is due to newer version of files
from the build systems) or from any mirror of that server
(http://www.gnupg.org/mirrors.html).

SHA-1 checksums are:

Noteworthy changes in version 1.0.4 (2008-09-22)
------------------------------------------------

 * Write smimeCapabilities according to RFC3851 to help Mozilla.

 * Support DSA.

 * The visibility attribute is now used if supported by the toolchain.


Commercial support contracts for Libksba are available, and they help
finance continued maintenance.  g10 Code, a Duesseldorf based company
owned and headed by Libksba's principal author, is currently funding
its development.  We are always looking for interesting development
projects.  See also http://www.gnupg.org/service.html .


Happy hacking,
